## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how keyboard activity monitoring works at a behavioral level to help understand how malicious keyloggers operate, enabling better detection and prevention strategies.

## Features

- Real-time Monitoring**: Captures keyboard events in real-time.
- Key Categorization**: Classifies keys into letters, numbers, symbols, and control keys.
- Data Encryption**: Encrypts captured data for secure storage.
- Visualization**: Displays key statistics and the sequence of key presses.

## Ethical Design
- Requires explicit user consent
- No network transmission
- Local encrypted storage only
- Auto-terminates after a fixed duration

## Skills Demonstrated
- Malware behavior analysis
- Secure coding practices
- Cryptography (Fernet/AES)
- Python system monitoring

## Disclaimer
This project is strictly for educational and defensive cybersecurity research purposes.
